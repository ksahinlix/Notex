# Notex — Project Log

This file records **what** we build, **why** we chose it, and **how** it works.
It is the project's memory: read it to understand any past decision, and add
to it whenever something meaningful changes.

- **Decisions** (section 2) are numbered and never deleted. If a decision
  changes, add a new one that *supersedes* the old one and mark the old one.
- **Log** (section 4) is a diary of work, newest at the bottom.

## 1. What is Notex?

A personal, hierarchical note app (like OneNote: *Category > Folder > … > Page*,
unlimited depth) with:

- AI that **suggests where a note belongs** and **searches by meaning**.
  AI runs on the user's device, not on a server.
- Checklist items (e.g. "Watch list"), reminders, comments and images on notes.
- Password-protected folders with end-to-end encryption. The server only ever
  sees encrypted data for those folders.

**Platform priority:** 1) a well-working **web app** → 2) **mobile** → 3) maybe **desktop**.

The original design came from a single-file React prototype built in
Claude.ai: [`prototype.jsx`](prototype.jsx). The original Turkish project
summary is kept in [`original-summary-tr.md`](original-summary-tr.md).

### D1 — Start from scratch
- **What:** New repository structure. `docs/prototype.jsx` is kept only as a
  reference for features and look.
- **Why:** The prototype is one 1,000-line component tied to the Claude.ai
  sandbox (`window.storage`, direct Claude API calls). Splitting it into
  modules while rebuilding is cleaner than refactoring it in place.

### D2 — Web first, then mobile, then maybe desktop
- **What:** Build a solid web app first. Mobile starts as a **PWA** (the same web
  app, installable, offline-capable). Move to Expo/React Native only if the PWA
  isn't enough. Desktop is optional (the PWA also installs on desktop).
- **Why:** One codebase serves all three for as long as possible.

### D3 — On-device AI for search and classification only
- **What:**
  - **Search:** an *embedding model* (planned: `multilingual-e5-small` through
    transformers.js, ~100 MB). Each note becomes a vector of numbers, and search
    ranks notes by how close their vector is to the query's vector.
  - **Classification:** first find the nearest *existing* folder using
    embeddings (fast, cheap). Use a small generative model (1–3B, via WebLLM)
    **only as a classifier that returns JSON**, and only when a new folder name
    or a reminder date must be produced. There is no chat UI.
  - The app must still work without AI: typing the path by hand always works.
- **Why:**
  - The home server can't run LLMs, and free hosting has no GPU.
  - On-device AI also keeps notes private.
  - The prototype sent *all notes* in one prompt for search. That breaks with
    small local models (short context) once there are more than a few dozen
    notes. Embeddings scale to thousands of notes.
- **Open:** which generative model (Qwen / Gemma / Phi) — to be picked by
  testing on real Turkish notes. Qwen is the first candidate for Turkish.
- **Privacy note:** embeddings reveal what a note is about. Embeddings of
  encrypted notes must stay on the device, or be encrypted before syncing.

### D4 — Backend: Node.js + Express
- **What:** `server/`. Stores notes, protected-folder records and the login
  session. No AI logic.
- **Why:** Small, well known, and free to host.

### D5 — Database: Postgres on Neon
- **What:** Neon free tier. The schema is in `server/db/schema.sql`.
- **Why:** Render's free services have no persistent disk (SQLite would be wiped
  on each restart), and Render's free Postgres expires after 30 days. Neon's free
  tier persists; it only "sleeps" when idle.
- **Limit to watch:** 0.5 GB of storage. Images are stored inline for now (see
  Open questions).

### D6 — One Render web service for API + web app
- **What:** `render.yaml`. The build compiles `web/` into `web/dist`, and the
  Express server serves those files next to `/api/*`. In development, Vite
  proxies `/api` to the server so it behaves the same way.
- **Why:** One origin means no CORS setup and allows the safest cookie
  settings (`SameSite=Strict`). It also means one free service instead of two.
- **Known cost:** the free service sleeps after ~15 min idle, and the first
  request after that takes ~30–60 s. Mitigated later by offline-first storage
  (D9 / roadmap).

### D7 — Single-user login
- **What:**
  - The owner's password is stored only as a **scrypt hash** in the
    `APP_PASSWORD_HASH` environment variable.
  - Login sets an **httpOnly, SameSite=Strict cookie** holding a token signed
    with `SESSION_SECRET` (HMAC-SHA256), valid for 30 days.
  - Login attempts are rate-limited to 10 per 15 minutes per IP.
  - Code: `server/src/auth.js`.
- **Why:**
  - Login must exist *before* deploying: without it, anyone who finds the URL
    can read or delete the notes.
  - A single user needs no users table or third-party auth service.
  - Built-in Node crypto means no extra dependencies.
- **Supersede when:** multiple users are needed.

### D8 — Folder encryption (fixed from the prototype)
- **What:**
  - Folder key = PBKDF2-SHA256 (**600,000** iterations) of the password and a
    random salt → AES-GCM-256.
  - To check a password, we store `checkCipher`, a known value encrypted with
    the key. The password is correct if and only if it decrypts.
  - For encrypted notes, **all** text fields (text, list item text, reminder
    label, blocks, comments) go into the ciphertext.
  - Code: `web/src/lib/crypto.ts`.
- **Why (the prototype had these problems):**
  1. It stored `sha256(password + salt)`. SHA-256 is extremely fast, so anyone
     with the database could brute-force it and skip the slow PBKDF2 step
     entirely. Now no hash is stored.
  2. It used 100k iterations; OWASP recommends 600k.
  3. It left `reminderLabel` in plaintext on encrypted notes.
  4. When a folder was locked or a note was moved into one, it dropped
     `blocks`, so inline images were lost.
- **Still visible to the server:** folder/page names (`path`), checkbox state
  and reminder time. This lets the tree and reminders work while locked.
  Accepted for now.

### D9 — Sync model
- **What:**
  - Note IDs are UUIDs generated by the client.
  - `PUT /api/notes/:id` creates or replaces a note, and is accepted only if its
    `updatedAt` is newer than the server's copy. Otherwise the server returns
    `409` with its current version (last-write-wins).
  - `DELETE` doesn't remove the row: it sets `deleted_at` (a "tombstone") and
    wipes the content.
  - `GET /api/notes?since=<time>` returns every change after that time,
    including deletions.
- **Why:** This is the groundwork for offline-first use. The app will store
  notes on the device (IndexedDB), work without a connection or while Render
  wakes up, and sync in the background. Client-side IDs let notes be created
  offline. Tombstones let other devices learn about deletions.

### D10 — Web stack
- **What:**
  - `web/`: Vite + React + TypeScript, Vitest for tests, oxlint for linting.
  - `server/`: plain JavaScript (ES modules) and Node's built-in test runner.
  - Node 22+.
- **Why:**
  - TypeScript catches mistakes in the fairly complex note model and UI.
  - The server is small; plain JS avoids a build step there.

### D11 — Home server = backup only (Phase 2)
- **What:** Later, pull a regular `pg_dump` from Neon to the home server
  (Debian 13, i5-7500T, 16 GB RAM, old 320 GB HDD, Docker, Tailscale). It hosts
  nothing in Phase 1.
- **Why:** Its hardware is too weak for LLMs and its disk is old. It is a good
  second copy of the data, but not a good primary host.

---

## 3. Open questions

- **Images:** inline base64 in note content for now (up to 10 MB per request).
  Plan: move to a separate table or object storage (e.g. Cloudflare R2 free
  tier), encrypted in the browser for protected folders.
- **Reminder delivery:** Web Push needs a server to send at the right time, but
  the free Render service sleeps. Plan: an external free scheduler (GitHub
  Actions cron or cron-job.org) calls a `/api/reminders/due` endpoint every few
  minutes. iOS delivers web push only to PWAs added to the home screen.
- **Rich-text editor:** the prototype uses `document.execCommand`, which is
  deprecated. Consider TipTap or Lexical when porting the composer.
- **Generative model choice** for classification (see D3).

## 4. Log

### 2026-09-22 — Project kickoff and foundation
**What we did**
- Reviewed the prototype and the original summary. Agreed on decisions D1–D11.
- Created the repository layout:
  ```
  server/   Express API (auth, notes, protected folders) + Postgres schema
  web/      Vite + React + TS app (login screen + connection check for now)
  docs/     this log, the prototype, the original summary
  render.yaml, CLAUDE.md, README.md
  ```
- **Server:**
  - `GET /api/health`
  - `POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/logout`, `GET /api/auth/me`
  - `GET /api/notes[?since=]`, `PUT /api/notes/:id`, `DELETE /api/notes/:id`
  - `GET`, `PUT /:pathKey` and `DELETE /:pathKey` under `/api/protected-folders`
  - Migrations run on every start (the schema is idempotent).
- **Web:**
  - Typed data model (`src/lib/types.ts`), API client (`src/lib/api.ts`),
    folder-tree helpers (`src/lib/tree.ts`) and the fixed encryption module
    (`src/lib/crypto.ts`).
  - Login screen, and a home screen that confirms the server and database are
    reachable.

**How it was verified**
- Server: 5 tests (`npm test`). The API tests ran against a real local
  Postgres, covering login, create/update/conflict/delete/sync and protected
  folders.
- Web: 7 tests (encryption round-trip and wrong password, tree helpers).
  `npm run build` and `npm run lint` pass.
- Manual smoke test: the server served the built web app, `/api/notes` returned
  401 without login, and login followed by listing notes worked.

**Next**
1. Create a Neon project, fill in `server/.env`, run locally (see README).
2. Deploy to Render with `render.yaml`.
3. Port the notes UI from the prototype into components (tree sidebar,
   composer, note list, password modal, lightbox).
4. Offline-first storage: IndexedDB plus background sync.
5. AI: embeddings search, then classification.
6. PWA: manifest, service worker, install prompt.
7. Reminders via Web Push and an external cron.
8. Phase 2: backups to the home server.
